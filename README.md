## What?

🐶. **hashipets** is a collection of snippets for use with HashiCorp tools like
Consul, Nomad, Packer, Terraform, Vagrant, and Vault. The snippets are kept in a TOML file that is compatible with the simple command-line snippet manager [pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet).

## Why?

It's a nice means of recalling and sharing complex one-liners and seldom used commands.

## How?

Using the fantastic CLI utility `pet` and the [hashipets.toml] in this repository, you'll be comanding HashiCorp tools like a pro in no time!

### Quick Start for macOS

0. Clone this repository within some `$DIR`
1. Install `pet`: `brew install knqyf263/pet/pet`
2. Configure: `pet configure`
3. Point `snippetfile` to `$DIR/hashipets/hashipets.toml`, save, and exit
4. 🎉

### What's Next?

You can optionally customize the `peco` fuzzy finder tool like so:

```
$ mkdir $HOME/.config/peco && \
  cp $DIR/hashipets/peco_config.json $_/config.json
```

Then use `pet` in awesome ways:

#### List all snippets

```
$ pet list
```

#### Search snippets

```
$ pet search
```

#### Add search result to clipboard on macOS

```
$ pet search | pbcopy
```

#### Execute a snippet

```
$ pet exec
```

#### Interactively add a snippet

```
$ pet new
Command> curl -s <consul_http_addr>/v1/status/peers
Description> Get Consul server peers from HTTP API
```

See the [pet documentation](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet/blob/master/README.md) for more ways to use it!
